How to set this up until I put it into a compressed file or something:

1. Create one file called FPL or whatever you like
2. Create two files inside it, one called 'scripts' and one called 'settings'.
3. Create one file inside the scripts folder called 'my_classes'
4. Within the 'my_classes' folder, put the FPL_4.py file.
5. Move up one folder and within the scripts directory put the four other scripts:
'download_json', wrangling_csvs', 'Graph Creation', 'Havertz Graph'
6. Move to the settings folder and put the game.json file in there
7. Open the game.json and update the league_id to your draft league id. This can be found in the url when you navigate from 'https://draft.premierleague.com/league' to the 'Edit League'. This is only an option for league admins, not sure how to find it if you're not an admin.
7b. You can also change the name of the 'prefix_folder', this dictates the folder that the data will flow into
8. Run 3 of the python scripts in the scripts folder in this order: 'download_json', wrangling_csvs', 'Graph Creation'
9. Review the outputs in the directory: <folder created in part 1>/<prefix_folder>

Havertz Graphs are bar graphs that track a player's GW scores vs their draft league ownership. The id is configurable in the game.json Havertz Graph id field. Once the first three scripts have been run, update the id to a valid player id (get this from the bootstrap csv in the directory draft\processed\bootstrap) and run the python script to generate a graph.

Info about the outputs:
Raw data is stored in the folder 'extracts'
Processed data and graphs are stored in the folder 'processed'
Havertz Graphs are stored in the folder 'processed\graphs\bar_plots\gw_reviews' and are saved as the player's last name. 

More info to come.
